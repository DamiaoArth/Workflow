🛠 Prompt: Workspace UI Refactor & Role-Based Agent Settings
Enhance the current Work Mode interface of the React + Tailwind-based workspace application to better align with agent behavior and modular configuration logic. The focus is on clarifying the role of Agent Settings, expanding team/assistant visibility, and refining UI layout and interaction logic.

📍Key UI Adjustments
Reassign the Top-Right “Agent Settings” Button

The current purple Agent Settings button (top-right) should no longer open the model/tools configuration.

Update its role to a new function such as:

Team Overview

Agent Dashboard

Project AI Hub

This will serve as a high-level view of team status, agent allocation, sprint overviews, etc.

Preserve and Expand the Bottom “Agent Settings” Button

The Agent Settings button located below the chat input becomes the main access point for configuring:

AI model (GPT-4o-mini, etc.)

Tool access

MCP installation/enabling

Memory/session/knowledge settings

Clicking this opens a modal with full configuration control for assistants, agents, and teams.

🧠 Behavior Switch Between Chat & Coding
The Chat ↔ Code Editor toggle should not switch between a text interface and an IDE.

Instead, it should change the operational mode of the active agent:

Chat: normal conversational behavior (like ChatGPT).

Code: agent executes code-related tasks:

Builds directory structure

Writes scripts

Interprets system-level actions

Behaves like Codium, Replit, or AutoDev tools

📦 UI and Layout Improvements
Expand Chat Output Area

Increase the height and max-lines of the agent's message output.

Allow scrollable history with subtle shadows or overflow indicators.

Pin Input Controls to the Bottom

The input bar, including:

Text input field

Send button

Voice input

Code view toggle

Agent settings (bottom version)

Should be anchored to the bottom of the page for consistent UX.

👥 Team & Assistant Visibility
Add New UI Sections Below Sprints

Create new labeled sections in the main interface for:

Assistants: display currently available assistant roles and their configurations.

Teams: list all active agent teams, their roles, members, and current status.

Each entry should support:

Inline editing or modal popups for config

Status indicators (online, executing, idle)

Model and session info
