Enhanced Workspace Functionality Specification
A React-based workspace application with integrated AI agents designed to facilitate the planning, execution, and monitoring of personal projects through a fully automated Kanban system. The application features intelligent chat interactions, real-time task delegation, dynamic agent efficiency, and an extensible modular interface.

üîë Core Enhancements
Manual Task Deletion: Tasks created manually via the Kanban board can now be removed directly, allowing for a cleaner and more flexible task management experience.

Dynamic Agent Efficiency: Agent performance is evaluated based on real-time metrics (e.g., task success rate, average execution time, and reassignments), replacing static efficiency values with adaptive scoring mechanisms.

Layout Fixes: Resolved the overlapping issue between the Personal App Project container and the navigation bar, ensuring proper layer separation and responsive design integrity.

Dark Mode Support: Implemented a fully theme-aware interface with a dark mode toggle. Preferences persist via local storage and apply across all UI elements using Tailwind‚Äôs dark: utility classes.

üß™ Work Mode Enhancements
Sectioned View: Work mode is now split into two distinct sub-sections:

Chat View: A conversational interface similar to ChatGPT or DeepSeek for general communication, prompt interaction, and assistance.

Coding View: A full-featured, prompt-driven development environment where agents can:

Generate and edit code snippets

Build file structures

Simulate or preview application logic

Behaves similarly to tools like Codium, Replit, or Cline.

Agent Settings Panel: Added a functional modal that allows users to configure:

Assistants: Personality, model, prompt scope

Agents: Roles, responsibilities, and tools

Teams: Agent groupings for specific projects or sprints

Also displays and allows editing of core runtime settings: session, memory, knowledge, tools, models, and MCP logic

üß¨ UI Extensions
Assistants and Teams Management: Extended the interface to support listing and configuring Assistants and Teams alongside Agents. Each entity includes editable metadata, current status, performance insights, and interaction logs.
